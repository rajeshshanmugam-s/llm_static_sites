    <h1>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What is Natural Language Processing?</h2>
        <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. It enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and valuable. NLP combines computational linguistics with machine learning to process and analyze large volumes of natural language data.</p>
        <p>Common applications include speech recognition, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. By leveraging NLP, developers can create systems that respond to voice commands, summarize text, or even detect emotions in written communication.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications of NLP</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Machine Translation:</strong> Translating text or speech from one language to another (e.g., Google Translate).</li>
            <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> Determining the emotional tone of text, such as reviews or social media posts.</li>
            <li><strong>Chatbots and Virtual Assistants:</strong> Automating customer service interactions (e.g., Siri, Alexa).</li>
            <li><strong>Text Summarization:</strong> Condensing lengthy documents into concise summaries.</li>
            <li><strong>Named Entity Recognition:</strong> Identifying key elements like names, dates, and locations in text.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Why is NLP Important?</h2>
        <p>NLP bridges the gap between human communication and computer understanding. As data grows exponentially, the ability to process and derive insights from unstructured text and speech becomes critical. Businesses use NLP to improve customer experiences, researchers use it to analyze literature, and developers create smarter tools that adapt to user needs.</p>
        <p>With advancements in deep learning and neural networks, NLP continues to evolve, enabling more accurate and context-aware language models. This technology is shaping the future of communication, accessibility, and automation across industries.</p>
