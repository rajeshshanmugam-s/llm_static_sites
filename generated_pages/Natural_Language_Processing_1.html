        <h1>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h1>
        <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans. It enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way. NLP combines computational linguistics with machine learning to process and analyze large volumes of natural language data.</p>

        <h2>Applications of NLP</h2>
        <p>NLP is used in various real-world applications, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Machine Translation:</strong> Translating text or speech from one language to another (e.g., Google Translate).</li>
            <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> Determining the emotional tone behind words, often used in social media monitoring.</li>
            <li><strong>Chatbots and Virtual Assistants:</strong> Tools like Siri, Alexa, and customer service chatbots rely on NLP to understand and respond to user queries.</li>
            <li><strong>Speech Recognition:</strong> Converting spoken language into text, such as in voice-activated assistants.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Key Techniques in NLP</h2>
        <p>Common techniques include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tokenization:</strong> Breaking text into individual words or phrases.</li>
            <li><strong>Named Entity Recognition (NER):</strong> Identifying and classifying entities like names, dates, and locations.</li>
            <li><strong>Part-of-Speech Tagging:</strong> Labeling words with their grammatical roles (e.g., noun, verb).</li>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning Models:</strong> Using algorithms like RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers (e.g., BERT) for complex language tasks.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Why NLP Matters</h2>
        <p>NLP bridges the gap between human communication and computer understanding. As data grows exponentially, the ability to process unstructured text becomes critical for businesses, researchers, and developers. From improving customer service to enabling AI-driven insights, NLP is transforming industries worldwide.</p>
